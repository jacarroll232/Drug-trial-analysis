# Drug Trial analysis



My objective was to determine which drug was most effective in treating mice, and display the data for others to visualize. 
I analyzed clinical trial data of four drug treatments on mice, and created scatter plots and graphs to display the data. I also included some written observable trends based on the visualizations.



The drug data included four drug treatments: Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and a placebo.



The scatter plots and bar graph i created are as follows:


- tumor volume changes over time for each treatment

- how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment

- shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)

- bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days

Capomulin was shown as the most superior drug treatment of the four, regardless of the angle of data chosen to analyze.
