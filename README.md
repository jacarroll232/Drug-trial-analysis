Drug Trial analysis



I analyzed clinical trial data of four drug treatments on mice, and created scatter plots and graphs to display the data. I also included some written observable trends based on the visualizations.


The drug data included four drug treatments: Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and a placebo.


The scatter plots and bar graph i created are as follows:

- tumor volume changes over time for each treatment

- how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment

- shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)

- bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days
